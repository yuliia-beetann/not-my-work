                    <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I
                        watched
                        C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time...
                        like
                        tears in rain... <span class="em">Time to die.</span></p>

                    <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever
                        had
                        before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...
